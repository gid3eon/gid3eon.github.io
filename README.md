# Project Title

LITTLE B WINS

## Description

The goal of this project was for me to set up a website and have some Boilerplate code to look back on when I continue to explore web design.

## My Sources
So a lot of this, at least the html layout and the bare bones, I followed along with the work we did setting up websites in class.
I also followed along with a code camp site, breaking down how to setup a portfolio website.

I also "borrowed" some code from an artists website.

### CSS File
So, I spent a lot of time trying to get my nav bar to stick to the top. It took me way too much time to realize that I had simply called my css file incorrectly in my html file. Doing this made me realize how important it is to simply organize your files. 

### BUWGA and Mobile Compatibility
At first I went into this wanting to learn how to navigate both mobile and desktop web design seamlessly. Spent a lot of time early on trying to figure out how to make a burger menu, you can see remnants of the various attempts in the code. At a point I gave up on this and focused on getting an actual site up and running.

### Format
Most of the other issues I ran into revolved around formatting. Naming variables in a way which you'll understand is really important to an efficient html index and helps when styling your content.
